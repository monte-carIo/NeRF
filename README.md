# NeRF
- [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934v2.pdf) is a novel approach for synthesizing novel views of a scene given only a sparse set of input images. It represents a scene as a continuous 3D function that models the radiance (color and intensity of light) at any point in space. This is in contrast to traditional methods that often rely on discrete 3D representations or point clouds.

- This code re-implemented Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis model (NeRF) from the research paper.
